## Installation

- Download the ZIP code or clone the repository inside Raspberry PI 3 B+ with
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lmolinario/ML_Sec_project.git
  ```
- Install the requirements with

  ```

- Run the file `entrypoint.py` to start the program (in UNIX-like System)

### Before running it, make sure you have Python 3.0 installed.

## Project goal
The aim of this project is to re-evaluate 5 RobustBench models with another attack algorithm (e.g. FMN) and identify samples for which one attack works and the other doesn't.
