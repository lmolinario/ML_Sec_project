## Installation

- Download the ZIP code or clone the repository inside Raspberry PI 3 B+ with
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lmolinario/ML_Sec_project.git
  ```
- Install the requirements with

  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Run the file `entrypoint.py` to start the program (in UNIX-like System)

### Before run ensure yor are installed Python 3.9 

## Project goal
The aim of this project is to re-evaluate 5 RobustBench models with another attack algorithm (e.g. FMN) and identify samples for which one attack works and the other doesn't. 


## Solution Design



## Conclusions

In order to analyze the data obtained and make them accessible to the most, I decided to use a methodology used to make strategic choices starting from the map of factors (both internal and external, positive or negative) that can influence the choice itself.


This methodology is called “SWOT” analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats).

The SWOT is made up of a 2×2 matrix in which the factors that have a potential, positive or negative impact on what is being analyzed or wanted to be achieved are appropriately identified and organised.

Let's immediately list what we thought were the relevant factors to include in our analysis.
